								<p>The informal economy, like the formal economy, is an integral part of the whole economy. From a purely definitional point of view, what makes an enterprise ‘informal’ is the fact that it operates under different legal constraints from its formal counterparts (Monroy,2012). The informal economy accounts for a big proportion of the economy, especially in developing countries. Informal economies are activities that circumvent the costs and are excluded from the legal benefits covering property relationships, commercial licensing, labor contracts, torts, financial credit and social security systems (Feige,1990). In contrast, the informal economy accounts for a larger proportion in developing countries and is more difficult to transition to formal economy. In this paper, I will firstly analyze the relationship of formal and informal enterprises, the cost and possible results for government to assist or support the informal sector, finally evaluate whether the government should support the development of the informal economy and my own opinions.By the way, check out my <a href="#kms">main analysis</a>.</p>

								<h4 class="major">2.Why the government should support the informal sector?</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/imfs.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><h3 class="major">2.1 Higher Employment Rate</h3>Women, young people, older people, migrants, indigenous and tribal people, HIV-infected people and ADIS, disabled people, people sustain with a minimum allowance, they are more likely to suffer labor deficits and discrimination especially in developing countries, these people usually take up a larger proportion of the labor market, for example, as Fox (2013) and colleagues have observed, current demographic trends indicate that the modern sector in Africa will not be able to absorb the migration out of agriculture for decades to come. This evidence supports the assumption that the informal sector helps to avoid human capital accumulation and labor redundant. The informal economy carries the advantages of allowing open entry, and providing opportunities for those with little education and no capital.</p><p><h3 class="major">2.2 Externalities & Spillover effect lower the cost</h3>First, we introduce the concept of agglomeration, Duranton (2008) claimed that agglomeration economies are generated within both formal and informal firms. The increasing number of formal and informal sectors lead to a sharing of indivisible goods and infrastructures, diversity benefits, individual professional income, risk prevention. Also, the agglomeration of the labor force efficiently improves the matching of unemployment and vacant jobs, quality and price, skills and wages. It shows that the formal establishment benefits from an increase in the number of informal suppliers. Moreover, a manufacture’s production needs to input raw materials from other manufacturers, which means that the aggregation of manufacturers caused by the increasing amount of the formal and informal industries will increase the demand for raw materials, and the aggregation effect caused by the stimulation to suppliers will reduce the price of raw materials. In addition, agglomeration economy can provide more information and choices for the labor force seeking for jobs. For workers, it reduces the cost of transferring jobs while for enterprises, it means a lower cost and more choices of finding labor. Overall, agglomeration not only boosts productivity efficiently but also reduces the average cost of production. Without so many restrictions, the informal suppliers are more innovative and the savings from trading with cheaper suppliers overcome the costs associated with their formality status.</p>

								<h4 class="major">3.Why the government shouldn't support the informal sector?</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/fst.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><h3 class="major">3.1 Poor competitiveness</h3>The informal firms are typically small, inefficient, and run by poorly educated entrepreneurs. With the expansion of the city scale, the transportation facilities and infrastructure boost the externalities for urban enterprises. Because of the spillover effects, more competition pushes market share towards lower cost, and therefore presumably more efficient, producers – pushing out less efficient firms and raising the productivity bar for entry. Most of the entrepreneurs of informal enterprises do not have enough supported knowledge to improve their productivity and competitiveness, that’s why they have less capable managers, lower capital-labor ratios, lower wages and lower profits (De Paula and Scheinkman 2011; La Porta and Schleifer 2008), so most of the small-scale informal firms that migrated to cities may be eliminated.</p><p><h3 class="major">3.2 Taxes & Less revenue</h3>Notoriously, Informal workers and businesses do not pay income tax and also corporate tax to the government in the same way as formal ones because they are unregistered. That means the government cannot broaden the tax base, though, taxation of more people creates accountability of government to more of its people, particularly the poor. In low-income areas of low-income countries, it’s impossible to raise much local revenue from anywhere, so market taxes are often the most important source of local government revenue. As a result, the municipal government may experience a significant tax shortfall and thus worsen its ability to provide public goods for the wider society, which the informal sector needed most. If the informal sectors refuse to pay taxes, it causes a sense of unfairness that might also decrease compliance amongst formal firms.</p><p><h3 class="major">3.3 Problems without regulations</h3>Informal means they are outside the law, and so more vulnerable to abuse over wages, conditions, maltreatment, dismissal, etc. The informal sector is not supervised by the government, so their transactions may involve illegal goods or criminal activities.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/concl.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Comparing the positive and negative consequences, it seems that supporting the informal sector is a better choice. In a short time, the informal sector is still an integral part of the economy, and we cannot deny that informal sectors benefit the local GDP and employment especially for developing countries. With a proper support of the government, the negative impacts of the informal economy will be effectively controlled.</p>

                			<p><h3 class="major">5.1 Utility of Legalization</h3>If we define the formal economy and informal economy according to whether they signed a labor contract and whether they had a business license, we can find that the informal economy generally exists in all social strata. It is an important fact for people to get stable contracts that can protect their jobs in the labor market. But in this case, we need to test whether the labor contract can bring higher returns, so the government should make sure the formal sectors can provide a relatively higher income to attract more informal sectors to transform to formals.</p><p><h3 class="major">5.2 Taxing and Subsiding informal sectors</h3>First, taxing informal sectors make them already have a degree of legitimacy in the eyes of their members. Further, the extra taxes eases the financial pressure of the country that helps them break old bargains with informal sector organizations. To make sure the equality of taxation and avoid too many burdens, the government can apply taxation according to the proportion of women and worker composition of different kinds of businesses in the local area. The expansion and development of the informal sector are usually limited by a lack of access to credit, so whether a small-scale informal firm has enough money can directly affect their survival. The extra taxation can use to support specific informal sectors that have the ability to compete with formal firms and can bring positive externalities for the local area.</p>
